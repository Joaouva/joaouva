### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h1>I'm JoÃ£o and I'm a Junior Web Developer</h1>

<p>After a decade working on sales and management roles I decided to switch my career and pursue my long lost love, develop things for the web and became a Web Developer.
Graduated @ Ironhack, I'm now a proud Web Developer with a good knowledge of front-end and back-end technologies with a huge drive to learn more!


âš¡ I'm currently exploring and improving my skills in React.JS, Next.JS and Express.JS, so if you have a project related with that tech stack let's talk and share ideas.
<p>

 Feel free to pick whatever you need for your projects!
